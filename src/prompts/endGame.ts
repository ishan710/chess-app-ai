You are in the endgame. Many pieces have been traded, and pawns and kings become very important.
Your goal is to convert advantages into a win or hold for a draw if behind.

Examples of endgame strategies:
- Activate your king (e.g., bring it toward the center with Kf4 or Kd3).
- Push passed pawns to promotion (e.g., a5 → a6 → a7 → a8=Q).
- Use rooks actively behind passed pawns (e.g., Rb1 behind a b-pawn).
- Cut off the enemy king and restrict its movement.
- Trade into a favorable pawn ending if ahead, or avoid pawn trades if behind.
- Defend weaknesses carefully and look for drawing techniques like building a fortress or perpetual check.

Suggest a move that improves your position using these endgame principles, aiming for pawn promotion, king activity, or counterplay depending on the situation.

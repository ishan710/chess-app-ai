You are in the endgame. Many pieces have been traded, and every move becomes crucial.
Pawns, king activity, and precise calculation are paramount. The margin for error is small.

ENDGAME PHILOSOPHY:
- PATIENCE IS KEY: Don't rush. The win may take 15-20 moves of careful maneuvering.
- TECHNIQUE OVER TACTICS: Perfect technique beats flashy moves in endgames.
- THINK LIKE A COMPUTER: Calculate forced sequences to the end (pawn races, king opposition).
- CONFUSE WITH PRECISION: Make moves that maintain all options while limiting opponent's choices.

ENDGAME STRATEGIC PRIORITIES:

1. KING ACTIVATION (Highest Priority):
   - Your king is a powerful piece in the endgame - use it!
   - Centralize the king or bring it toward passed pawns
   - Use opposition and triangulation to outmaneuver opponent's king
   - Cut off the enemy king from critical squares

2. PASSED PAWNS:
   - Create passed pawns by advancing or exchanging
   - Support passed pawns with pieces (rook behind, king in front)
   - Push passed pawns when the opponent's pieces are far away
   - Sometimes creating a second threat is better than pushing immediately

3. PIECE ACTIVITY & COORDINATION:
   - Rooks belong behind passed pawns (yours or opponent's)
   - Active rooks can attack from behind while defending
   - Keep pieces active and flexible
   - Restrict opponent's piece mobility

4. PAWN STRUCTURE:
   - Preserve good pawns, target weak ones
   - Create pawn majorities on one side of the board
   - Sometimes holding pawns is better than pushing them
   - Watch for stalemate tricks when opponent is desperate

5. WINNING vs DRAWING:
   - IF AHEAD: Trade pieces (not pawns) to simplify into won endgames
   - IF BEHIND: Keep pieces on the board, create counterplay, seek perpetual check or fortress
   - IF EQUAL: Activate pieces, look for small advantages

IMPORTANT: Endgames reward precision and patience. Don't grab material if it ruins your position. 
Sometimes the "quiet" move that improves king position or restricts opponent is stronger than capturing a pawn.

Choose a move that:
A) Activates your king toward the center or key squares, OR
B) Creates or advances passed pawns systematically, OR
C) Improves piece coordination while restricting opponent, OR
D) Sets up long-term zugzwang or winning maneuvers

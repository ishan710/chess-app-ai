You are in the middle game. The opening is mostly complete, and both sides have developed their pieces. 
Your goal is to coordinate your pieces, attack weaknesses, and keep your king safe.

Examples of middle game ideas:
- Placing rooks on open or semi-open files (e.g., Re1 or Rc1).
- Pushing a pawn break to open the center or attack (e.g., d4 or f5).
- Maneuvering knights to strong outposts (e.g., Nd5).
- Attacking weaknesses such as an isolated pawn or weak squares around the enemy king.
- Looking for tactical chances: forks, pins, skewers, or discovered attacks.
- Defending your own weak pawns and squares while keeping pressure.

Suggest a move that improves your position using these middle game strategies, balancing both tactical opportunities and long-term plans.

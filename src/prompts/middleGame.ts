You are in the middle game. The opening is mostly complete, and both sides have developed their pieces. 
Your goal is to build a superior position through strategic planning, not just immediate material gain.

STRATEGIC PHILOSOPHY:
- DON'T always chase immediate tactical gains or captures. Sometimes the best move creates long-term pressure.
- THINK 3-5 moves ahead. What position do you want to achieve? How will your pieces coordinate?
- TRY TO CONFUSE YOUR OPPONENT by making unexpected moves that don't reveal your plan immediately.
- Create multiple threats so your opponent doesn't know which one to defend against.
- Build up pressure gradually rather than rushing into forcing moves.

MIDDLEGAME STRATEGIC IDEAS:
1. POSITIONAL PLAY (Long-term advantage):
   - Improve piece placement even without immediate threats (e.g., rook to open file, knight to outpost)
   - Control key squares and restrict opponent's pieces
   - Create pawn weaknesses in opponent's position
   - Establish bishops on long diagonals
   - Double rooks on critical files

2. TACTICAL OPPORTUNITIES (When they fit the plan):
   - Forks, pins, skewers, discovered attacks
   - Attacking isolated or backward pawns
   - King safety threats
   - Breaking through with pawn breaks (e.g., d4, f5)

3. PIECE COORDINATION:
   - Connect your rooks
   - Place pieces to support each other
   - Create synergy between bishops and rooks
   - Use your queen wisely - not too early, not too passive

IMPORTANT: Balance is key. If a high-scoring tactical move doesn't fit your long-term plan, consider a quieter strategic move instead. 
The best players win by building superior positions, then converting advantages when the time is right.

Choose a move that either:
A) Improves your position strategically (even if it doesn't win material immediately), OR
B) Creates tactical threats that fit into a broader plan, OR
C) Makes an unexpected move that confuses the opponent while maintaining your advantages
